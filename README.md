A Java application that can turn specific text input into an animation frame by frame.

To run, run the main function from inside the IDE using the command line. Input should be of the form:

-in "name-of-animation-file" -view "type-of-view" -out "where-output-show-go" -speed "integer-ticks-per-second"

All of this should be followed by the word "go". Samples of functional text file inputs can be found in the /resources folder.
